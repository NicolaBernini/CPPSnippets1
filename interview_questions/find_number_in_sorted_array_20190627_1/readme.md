# Overview 

Find a given a number in a sorted array 





# Solution 

[Solution](sol1.cpp)

- Complexity is O(LogN) in average case 
- Can be improved to reduce the linear comeplxity related to the search of the bounds of the contiguous set of repeated number, searching these bounds using bisection again
