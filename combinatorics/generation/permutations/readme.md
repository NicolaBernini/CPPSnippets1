Some Permutations Computation related material 

# Basic Permutation 

## Problem Statement

> Given a vector of int, compute all the possible vectors resulting from the permutation of the elements 

## Solutions 

Analysis 

- Equivalent to drawing elements from a container 
- Recursive + Iterative 
  - Recursion i --> Recursion i+1 = Remove an element 
  - Iterations inside a Recursion = Run one recursion for each of the remaining elements 


Implementations 

- [CPP](permutations1.cpp)





Work in progress
