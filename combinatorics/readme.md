This section is related to Combinatorics Problems in Discrete Math hence including the following categories 

- Generation 
  - Examples 
    - Compute all the possible strings resulting from the permutation of a given set of chars 
    - Compute all the possible substrings for a given string 
    - Compute all the possible submatrixes for a given matrix 
  
- Enumaration / Counting 
  - Examples 
    - Count all the possible paths connecting 2 given points on a given graph 
    - Count the number of prime numbers in a given interval 
  
  
- Search 
  - Examples 
    - Search for a given element in a sorted array
