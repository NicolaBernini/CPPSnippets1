Some Exercises related to `unordered_map` `unordered_set` `map` `set` elements

# Set and Map access interface 

Iterability Access 

- Verify both the `unordered_set` and `set` provide in addition to the lookup semantic also the iterable semantic 
- Verify in case of `set` the order is defined by the `operator< ()` definition hence it is ascending and in case of `unordered_set` there is no order guarantee
