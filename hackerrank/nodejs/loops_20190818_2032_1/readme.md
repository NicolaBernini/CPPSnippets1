Solution to the [10 Days of Javascript - Day 2: Loops in Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-loops/problem?h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen) in NodeJS 

Solutions 
- [Sol1](sol1_20190818_2032_1.js)
  - This solution loops over the string with a traditional C-style loop as Javascript Strings do not natively provide the `forEach` semantic
  
- [Sol3](sol3_20190818_2035_1.js)
  - This solution loops also over the string with the forEach semantic as it gets transformed into an array of chars first by the `split('')` statement: this in fact tokenizes the string into an array which in fact supports the `forEach` semantic
